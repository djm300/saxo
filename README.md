# python-saxo
Python OpenAPI wrapper for Saxo Bank

### You'll need  
* Python 3.4 or above
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for Python
* [Saxo Developer Account](https://www.developer.saxo/)

### Info    
Create an app on your developer account (both DEMO/LIVE should work) using the following settings:

* Redirect URL: http://gttkeith.github.io/py-saxo/authcode
* Grant Type: Code
* Access control: â˜‘ Allow this app to be enabled for trading

Creating a new session:

```python
from pysaxo import Session
access = Session(app_key, auth_endpoint, token_endpoint, secret)
```

An example has been provided in the repo, where app details are stored in a params.json file.

py-saxo negotiates the authentication procedure using the complete OAuth2 authorization flow. Sessions are proactively refreshed to prevent unexpected logouts.
